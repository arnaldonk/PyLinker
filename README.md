# PyLinker
This tool represents a simulation of an interactive command line interface, designed to meet the needs of Cybersecurity Professionals. Its usefulness becomes evident in scenarios in which you face restrictions to establish more direct connections with the server, such as the presence of a Firewall that blocks the exit of TCP/UDP connections.

The main purpose of this tool is to provide a practical solution when security limitations prevent direct communication with the server. By simulating an interactive shell, it offers cybersecurity professionals an alternative way to interact with the system, thus overcoming the barriers imposed by Firewalls that restrict conventional connections.

Using this tool, cybersecurity experts can bypass firewall restrictions and perform essential tasks, maintaining a level of interactivity that makes it easy to execute commands and obtain critical information. This translates into greater flexibility and effectiveness in addressing situations where conventional connectivity is limited by security measures.
